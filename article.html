Freelancing isn’t just an internet thing—it actually has roots way back in history. Back in the 19th century, the term was used for soldiers who offered their skills to whoever needed them, instead of pledging lifelong loyalty. 

After the Industrial Revolution, work became centralized. Big companies hired people full-time for predictability and control. In the 21st century, the information revolution and the global internet changed the game.

Today, freelancing is more than just a way to earn money. It’s about building a personal brand, managing your own time, and navigating a competitive but opportunity-rich environment.

Did you know that although freelancing became popular through the internet, its history is actually older than the internet itself?



The history of freelancing goes back to the nineteenth century. At that time, the term “freelance” was used for soldiers who, instead of permanent loyalty to one king or government, offered their military skills to different sides in exchange for payment. This is exactly similar to what modern freelancers do today. They do not permanently belong to one company; instead, they offer their skills to different clients based on projects. For this reason, when this type of independent work became common again in the digital era, the same name — freelancing — was used.



After the twentieth century and especially following the Industrial Revolution, the labor market became highly centralized. Companies and global brands hired individuals as full-time employees. This structure was suitable for that time because industries required stability, physical presence, and long-term commitment. People followed predictable career paths, and employment was mainly considered a stable source of income.



However, in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, especially after the Information Revolution and the globalization of the internet, this traditional model began to create certain challenges. Companies started needing temporary workers instead of full-time employees because many tasks were short-term. They were often forced to pay large salaries for relatively small or time-limited projects. At the same time, the new generation no longer viewed jobs only as a source of income but also as part of their identity. They were no longer willing to follow a strictly linear and highly predictable employment path.

It was exactly at this moment that freelancing was reborn. It responded to the needs of its time. On one side, companies could reduce investment costs and even gain access to higher-quality global talent. On the other side, freelancing matched the desires of the younger generation. In freelancing, individuals have time flexibility — they can decide their working hours and workload. They also have location freedom and broader professional opportunities. A person can learn any skill they are interested in and earn income from it. Additionally, a freelancer can learn multiple skills at the same time and work with clients from different parts of the world.



This flexibility caused freelancing to grow rapidly in a short period of time and soon become a serious and respected career option. In some countries, according to various studies, many individuals earn at least part of their income through freelancing. This development attracted the attention of governments. Especially during economic crises, when many traditional jobs faced serious difficulties, freelancing showed strong adaptability and created new economic paths. Because of this flexibility, freelancing gradually moved from being considered a secondary job to being officially recognized as a primary and legitimate profession.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Freelancing


As mentioned earlier, freelancing is a relatively new income system, and based on current data, this trend is not only continuing but is expected to grow even further in the future. Many governments are redefining certain regulations to make freelancing easier and more structured. This will likely improve the relationship between governments and freelancers in the coming years.

One of the most fundamental features that distinguishes freelancing from traditional physical jobs is the ability to work from home or from anywhere. A freelancer can complete projects from any location. In the future, a person’s place of birth or residence will not determine where they can work — their skills will.

In traditional employment, a person works for a brand, but most of the recognition and long-term value belong to the brand owner. In freelancing, the individual becomes the brand. Through completed projects and experience, the freelancer builds a reputation in the market. Gradually, that person becomes a trusted name for clients. Trust is built based on performance, and the freelancer essentially becomes their own brand.



Time management is one of the most important skills a freelancer must master. In reality, a successful freelancer must be disciplined. Freelancing does not have fixed working hours. While this flexibility is an advantage, it can also become a disadvantage for individuals who lack self-control. Speed and efficiency are directly connected to income and success. Clients often choose those who can deliver high-quality work within shorter timeframes. This does not require overworking, but rather effective time management, balancing life and projects, and managing stress and expectations properly.



Of course, freelancing also has disadvantages. These include intense competition, income instability, financial uncertainty, and high expectations from clients.

Intense competition is one of the biggest overall challenges in freelancing. Many people are interested in this type of work. On most freelancing platforms, a person must either have strong credibility or offer lower prices to win projects. This creates a competitive environment where some individuals are willing to do heavy work for lower rates. This situation can create serious challenges for both experienced freelancers and newcomers.


Famous Freelancing Platforms and Their Characteristics


One of the most important factors influencing a freelancer’s success is choosing the right platform. Many successful freelancers work on multiple platforms, but they select them carefully and strategically.

Freelancer.com

One of the oldest and most well-known freelancing platforms. It provides access to multiple industries and global clients, offering diverse projects and competitive payments. However, its payment system can be complex, and the fee structure may sometimes be confusing for beginners.


Upwork

One of the largest and most recognized freelancing platforms in the world, with millions of projects and long-term clients. Its main advantage is its detailed rating system, skill-based filtering, and strong trust-building mechanisms between freelancers and clients. However, competition is very intense, which can make it more challenging for newcomers.


Fiverr

This platform gained global popularity because of its innovative concept of “gigs.” Freelancers create small service packages that clients can directly purchase. This model allows freelancers to be discovered faster and complete smaller projects quickly. However, it may limit pricing flexibility and often focuses more on smaller tasks.


Toptal

Toptal is a more exclusive platform that focuses on connecting top-tier freelancers with premium clients. It has a strict screening and selection process, meaning not everyone can join easily. However, freelancers who qualify often work on high-quality and high-paying projects. It is ideal for experienced professionals who have strong portfolios and advanced skills.
